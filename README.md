## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Streamlit library installed

## Installation

### Setting Up Development Environment in Local


Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GAmaranathaReddy/ai-agents.git
```

Go to the agent directory

```bash
  cd ai_health_fitness_agent
```

### Run using Poetry

#### Set up development environment

```bash
  poetry env use python3.12
```

This configures Poetry to use Python 3.12 as the interpreter for the project's virtual environment.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
  poetry install
```
This installs all dependencies specified in the pyproject.toml on each agent project file

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run run.py
   ```
### Run using virtual environment

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/GAmaranathaReddy/ai-agents.git)
   cd ai_health_fitness_agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   This will start the Streamlit server on port 8501 (default: 8501).

5. **Access the app**

   Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```



## Usage

## Customization
### CSS Customization
The app uses embedded CSS to style components. To update the style, modify the `st.markdown` section in `app.py`:
```python
st.markdown("""
<style>
/* Custom CSS here */
</style>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

### AI Model Configuration
The app initializes the `Ollama` model for LLM inference. To change the model:
```python
llm_model = Ollama(id="your-model-id")
```
Update the `id` parameter with the desired model identifier.

## FAQ
### How is the dietary plan generated?
The dietary plan is created using an AI agent configured with specific instructions to tailor recommendations based on user input, such as dietary preferences and fitness goals.

### How is the fitness plan generated?
The fitness plan is similarly generated by an AI agent designed to create actionable and detailed exercise routines based on user goals and activity levels.

### What if the AI key is invalid?
The app will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid key. Ensure the API key has sufficient access privileges.
